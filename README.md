# Deep-Learning-implementaion-on-FPGA-using-MATLAB
This repository contains MATLAB code which can be used to generate simulink model and HDL code for implementation on FPGA. Since HDL code generator cannot generate codes from Neural Network toolbox of MATLAB, I have written this MATLAB scripts using simple MATLAB functions that can be used for HDL code generation using HDL coder.
